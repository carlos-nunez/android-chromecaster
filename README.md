# Boalt Coding Challenge
## Requirements
- [x] Create an Android app that you self-host so that we can download it for review.
- [x] Use React Native
- [x] The app has to allow the user to watch a video (with full screen option) in the app. You
      can use any video of your choice or the one we provided.
- [x] It also needs to give the user the choice to stream it to the tv.
- [x] In terms of user experience, make sure to include minimal animations (1 or 2 is OK)
      when switching screens so that you can show off your animation skills.
- [x] Please submit your app within 48 hours.

## Details
- The app can be downloaded above (Universal.apk) or from https://schemer.app/universal.apk.
- I wasn't able to test the Chromecast functionality using an emulator. If there is a way to do so please let me know, I'll fix any problems and implement the full functionality with all the event listeners and expanded controls.

## Questions
- In the requirement for streaming the media to a tv, would one option such as Chromecast suffice? Or would streaming to Apple TV also need to be implemented?
- How can I test chrome cast using an android emulator?
